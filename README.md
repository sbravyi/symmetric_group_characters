This is a Matrix Product State (MPS) algorithm for computing characters of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$. 
The algorithm computes an MPS encoding all characters of a given conjugacy class of $S_n$. It relies on a mapping from characters of $S_n$ to quantum spin chains  proposed by
[Marcos Crichigno and Anupam Prakash](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04322)
